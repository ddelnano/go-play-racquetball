## Go Play Racquetball

If you are as forgetful as I am then, you never remember to reserve your racquetball courts.  Well now your time of forgetting to reserve courts 
is over! (if you are a la fitness member).  go-play-racquetball is an attempt to completely automate your recurring racquetball court reservations so
you don't have to remember to.  

If you are still reading this I am surprised you haven't stopped and thought this is the most useless project ever.

This is was an excuse to try out Go and write something simple.
  

## Todo
